# JS-CC-013 : Roman Numerals

Purpose of the this coding challenge is to write a code that given numbers convert to Roman Numerals. The Romans wrote numbers using letters - I, V, X, L, C, D, M. (notice these letters have lots of straight lines and are hence easy to hack into stone tablets).

Example: 1000=M 900=CM 90=XC; 2008 is written as MMVIII: 2000=MM 8=VIII

Write a function that takes normal number( 8, 148, 457 ) and convert to Roman Numerals( VIII, CXLVIII, CDLVII )

Please note that, there is no need to be able to convert numbers larger than about 3000. (The Romans themselves didn't tend to go any higher)
